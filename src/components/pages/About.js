      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio, I go by Maggie! I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona where I studied public health and Spanish at the University of Arizona.
        I attended graduate school thereafter at Northern Arizona University and became a Doctor of Physical Therapy. I moved to Boston, Massachusetts
        to complete a 1-year intensive physical therapy residency specializing in the rehabilitaiton of neurological conditions. I have since worked
        in hospitals and outpatient clinics as a physical therapist in both Washington, DC and Chicago.
        At this point in my career, I am learning to code! Otherwise I enjoy traveling domestically and internationally for both business and pleasure, trying new foods, and spending time with close
        friends and family.
